#PROJECT-1 (TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS)
The following project is about analyzing the sentiments of tweets on social networking website
‘Twitter’. The dataset for this project is scraped from Twitter. It contains 1,600,000 tweets
extracted using Twitter API. It is a labeled dataset with tweets annotated with the sentiment (0 =
negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).
It contains the following 6 fields:

1. target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
2. ids: The id of the tweet .
3. date: The date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
4. flag: The query. If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
5. user: The user that tweeted
6. text: The text of the tweet.

Design a classification model that correctly predicts the polarity of the tweets provided in the
dataset

#PROJECT-2 (RATINGS OF GUVI COURSES)
The following project is about Guvi Courses. The dataset for this project contains information
about Guvi courses in various categories, including course title, URL, price, number of
subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, course level, rating, content duration,
published timestamp, and subject. With this dataset, we can track the performance of courses
and uncover opportunities to generate revenue.

Design a regression model to predict the ratings given by the learners to the course

#PROJECT-3 (INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS)
Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded in 2010 by
Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and later acquired by American company Facebook Inc., now
known as Meta Platforms. The app allows users to share posts that can be shared publicly or
with pre-approved followers.
Instagram is very much used to influence people in a particular way for a specific issue - which
can impact the order in some ways. The following dataset is about such influencers. 
Answer the following questions based on the given data set:
1. Are there any correlated features in the given dataset? If yes, state the correlation
coefficient of the pair of features which are highly correlated.
2. What is the frequency distribution of the following features?
○ Influence Score
○ Followers
○ Posts
3. Which country houses the highest number of Instagram Influencers? Please show the
count of Instagram influencers in different countries using barchart.
4. Who are the top 10 influencers in the given dataset based on the following features
● Followers
● Average likes
● Total Likes
5. Describe the relationship between the following pairs of features using a suitable graph
● Followers and Total Likes
● Followers and Influence Score
● Posts and Average likes
● Posts and Influence Score

#PROJECT-4 (IMAGE CLASSIFICATION)
Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised
learning approach in which you are given a labeled dataset. In this particular problem, you need
to perform a binary classification of the given images. The binary classes identified are cats and
dogs. After extracting the suitable features from the images, design a binary classifier that
performs classification on the given data set. Also, evaluate the given classifier using all the
evaluation metrics.
You can download the data set from the given data source.
